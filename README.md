## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned em which is another unit for length. It depends on the font size. I used em unit a lot in this challenge. The default font size is set to 15px.

### Continued development

Still struggling with getting right values for width and height. I'd also like to learn more about when it's appropriate to use px, %, em, etc. I was able to set the bottom background pattern to the bottom right corner for desktop mode using

```css
background-position: right bottom;
```

but the same property didn't work when max-width was 375px for mobile mode.
